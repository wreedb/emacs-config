I decided to separate my Emacs configuration from my [[https://github.com/wreedb/config][wreedb/config]] repository 
because my Emacs directory became more elaborate than anything else in 
=~/.config=. I also have started preaching the good word of Emacs, so having 
a repository to send people to that just has my Emacs configuration and 
nothing else is more sensible.

*** Main points
+ No ~(use-package)~
  + sluggish performance
  + themes loaded through it override ~font-lock~ settings
+ No elpaca/straight, just plain old ~package.el~
+ corfu instead of company
+ telephone-line
+ dired-sidebar instead of treemacs
+ nerd-icons (and related integrations)
+ org-modern-mode
+ Keeping the ~user-emacs-directory~ strictly clean
  + ~#filename#~ all over the place? No.
  + Every package putting files in the config directory? No.
+ Avoiding legacy functions
  + ~(setopt ...)~ whenever possible
  + good: ~keymap-global-set~
  + bad: ~global-set-key~
+ ~custom.el~? never heard of them.
+ evil-mode + undo-fu
+ general.el + which-key
+ JetBrains Mono + ligature.el
+ eglot for LSP usage
+ Featureful but still lightweight and clean

I made a full effort to rewrite my config to work with without ~use-package~
or a third-party package manager. My motivation was to see just
how much of an effect it would have on startup time.

The result surprised me anyway.

external package manager + ~use-package~
- Average startup time of 2.8-3 seconds
with just ~package.el~ and manual configuration
- Average startup time of 1.4-1.5 seconds
