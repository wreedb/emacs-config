*** NOTE:
My configuration (mostly) can be viewed as a literate org document [[file:./emacs/README.org][here]].

I decided to separate my Emacs configuration from my [[https://github.com/wreedb/config][wreedb/config]] repository 
because my Emacs directory became more elaborate than anything else in 
=~/.config=. I also have started preaching the good word of Emacs, so having 
a repository to send people to that just has my Emacs configuration and 
nothing else is more sensible.
