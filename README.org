I decided to separate my Emacs configuration from my [[https://github.com/wreedb/config][wreedb/config]] repository 
because my Emacs directory became more elaborate than anything else in 
=~/.config=. I also have started preaching the good word of Emacs, so having 
a repository to send people to that just has my Emacs configuration and 
nothing else is more sensible.

*** Considerations
- No use-package
  * Confusing interactions with themes and font-lock
  * Sluggish performance
- Elpaca ([[https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca][link]])
  * Fast async package installs
- Keeping =~/.config/emacs= strictly clean
  * No littering of backup/autosave files or package
    specific directories outside of the cache directory
- Absolutely NO ~customize~ interface
  * The cusomize interface is a thorn in my side
- Very featureful but also very lightweight
